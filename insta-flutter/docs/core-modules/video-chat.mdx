# Video Chat

## Overview

Our application implements robust video and audio calling functionality using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), an industry-standard technology backed by tech giants like Google, Apple, and Microsoft. This document explains how our video chat feature works, its architecture, and key components.

## Technology Stack

- **WebRTC**: Core technology for peer-to-peer communication
- **flutter_webrtc**: Flutter plugin enabling WebRTC integration
- **Firebase**: Acts as the signaling server

## How It Works

### Basic Flow

1. **Call Initiation**:

   - User A initiates a call.
   - A WebRTC peer connection is created.
   - An "offer" (session description) is generated.
   - The offer is sent to Firebase (signaling server).

2. **Call Reception**:

   - User B's device listens for incoming call signals.
   - Receives the offer from Firebase.
   - Displays the incoming call screen.

3. **Call Acceptance**:

   - User B accepts the call.
   - Creates a peer connection.
   - Generates an "answer" (session description).
   - Sends the answer back through Firebase to User A.

4. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Devices exchange ICE candidates via Firebase.
   - A direct peer-to-peer connection is established.
   - Video/audio streams flow directly between devices.

## Key Components

#### 1. WebRTC Configuration

```dart
final Map<String, dynamic> _iceServers = {
  'iceServers': [
    {'url': 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302'},
    {
      'url': 'turn:95.217.132.49:80?transport=udp',
      'username': 'c38d01c8',
      'credential': 'f7bf2454'
    },
    {
      'url': 'turn:95.217.132.49:80?transport=tcp',
      'username': 'c38d01c8',
      'credential': 'f7bf2454'
    },
  ]
};
```

- **STUN Server**: Helps devices discover their public IP address.
- **TURN Server**: Acts as a relay when a direct connection fails. Ensures calls work even behind strict firewalls and across different network conditions.

#### 2. User Interface Components

We have dedicated screens for different call types:

- **VideoCallScreen**
- **VideoCallsGroupScreen**
- **VoiceCallScreen**
- **VoiceCallsGroupScreen**

Each screen handles both incoming and outgoing call displays with *key features* like:

- Video preview (for video calls)
- Remote participant display
- Audio mute/unmute
- Speaker toggle
- Call end button

```dart
class VideoCallScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final bool isCaller;
  final String? sessionDescription;
  final ChannelDataModel channelDataModel;
  // ... other parameters
}

```

#### 3. Call Handling Logic

We have specialized handlers for each call type:

- **VideoCallsHandler**
- **GroupVideoCallsHandler**
- **VoiceCallsHandler**
- **GroupVoiceCallsHandler**

These handlers are responsible for:

- Managing WebRTC peer connections
- Handling signaling via Firebase
- Managing media streams
- Coordinating call state changes



**Key Methods**:

```dart
void initCall(String token, String peerID, BuildContext context)
void acceptCall(String sessionDescription, String sessionType)
void bye()  // Ends the call

```

#### 4. Firebase Integration

Firebase serves as our signaling server:

- Enables real-time call state synchronization.
- Reliably delivers offers, answers, and ICE candidates.
- Handles call timeout and cleanup.

Example of sending an offer:

```dart
await firestore
    .collection(usersCollection)
    .doc(data['to'])
    .collection(callDataCollection)
    .doc(selfId)
    .set(request);

```

## Codebase Structure

Our video and audio call functionality is implemented in the following structure:

### One-on-One Calls

- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/video_call/video_call_screen.dart`**: Renders the incoming/outgoing calls screen for one-on-one video calls.
- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/video_call/video_calls_handler.dart`**: Core class managing one-on-one video calls. Handles call initiation, acceptance, and termination. Interacts directly with the WebRTC library.
- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/voice_call/voice_call_screen.dart`**: Renders the incoming/outgoing calls screen for one-on-one audio calls.
- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/voice_call/voice_calls_handler.dart`**: Core class managing one-on-one audio calls. Similar functionality to `VideoCallsHandler`, but for audio-only calls.

### Group Calls

- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/video_calls_group_chat/VideoCallsGroupScreen.dart`**: Renders the incoming/outgoing calls screen for group video calls.
- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/video_calls_group_chat/group_video_calls_handler.dart`**: Manages group video calls. Handles multiple peer connections.
- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/voice_calls_group_chat/voice_calls_group_screen.dart`**: Renders the incoming/outgoing calls screen for group voice calls.
- **`lib/core/ui/av_chat/voice_calls_group_chat/group_voice_calls_handler.dart`**: Manages group voice calls.

### Incoming Call Listener

- **`lib/<your-insta-flutter-app>/ui/container/container_screen.dart`**:
  - Method: `_listenForCalls()`.
  - Listens for incoming call signals from Firebase.
  - Launches the appropriate call screen based on the signal type.

## Advanced Features

#### Timeout Handling

Calls automatically end after 1 minute if not answered.

```dart
void startCountDown(BuildContext context) {
  countdownTimer = Timer(const Duration(minutes: 1), () {
    bye();
    stopRingtone();
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  });
}

```

#### Busy Detection

Prevents multiple incoming calls by checking if the recipient is already in a call.

#### Call History

Automatically logs calls in chat history and creates new chat channels if needed.

## Common Issues and Solutions

#### Call Failed to Connect

- Ensure both users have stable internet.
- Check if the TURN server is accessible.

#### Ringtone not Present 

- Check storage permission.

#### One-Way Audio/Video

- Verify microphone/camera permissions.
- Check if media tracks are properly added to the peer connection.

#### Call Drops

- Implement reconnection logic.
- Use multiple TURN servers for redundancy.
