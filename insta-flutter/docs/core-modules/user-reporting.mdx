# User Reporting 

User reporting and blocking are essential features required by both Apple and Google for mobile applications where users can create and share content. This functionality is crucial for:

- Messaging apps
- Dating platforms
- Social networks
- Marketplace applications
- Photo sharing services

Our implementation resides in `lib/core/utils/user_report/api/firebase/user_reporting_firebase_helper.dart`, serving as a central helper class for Firebase operations related to user reporting.

## Key Components

#### 1. UserReportingFireStoreUtils Class

This class extends `UserReportRepository` and implements the core functionality for user reporting and blocking.

**Main Methods**:

- `markAbuse()`
  - Purpose: Report or block a target user
  - Parameters:
    - `destUserID`: ID of the user being reported/blocked
    - `abuseType`: Type of abuse (e.g., 'report' or 'block')
    - `sourceUserID`: ID of the user initiating the action
  - Returns: `Future<bool>` indicating success or failure

- `unblockUser()`
  - Purpose: Unblock a previously blocked user
  - Parameters:
    - `destUserID`: ID of the user to unblock
    - `sourceUserID`: ID of the user initiating the unblock
  - Returns: `Future<bool>` indicating success or failure

- `fetchBlockedUsers()` (Not implemented)
  - Purpose: Retrieves the blocked/reported users from the “user_reports” table
  - Parameters:
    - `userID`: ID of the current user
    - `page`: Page number for pagination
    - `size`: Number of items per page
  - Returns: `Future<List<User>>`

#### 2. UserReportRepository Abstract Class

This abstract class defines the interface for user reporting functionality, ensuring consistency across different implementations.

#### 3. Constants

- `blockUserAction = 'block'`
- `reportUserAction = 'report'`

These constants are used to specify the type of action when calling `markAbuse()`.

## Firebase Implementation

By default, the app uses Firebase for storing user reports:

- Firestore table: `user_reports`
- This table is automatically created upon the first user report

## Customizing Backend

Your project already includes a `UserReportingCustomBackend` class that extends `UserReportRepository`. To use a custom backend instead of Firebase, follow these steps:

1. Implement the methods in `UserReportingCustomBackend`:

   Open `lib/core/utils/user_report/api/custom_backend/user_reporting_custom_backend.dart`. This file is intended for implementing your own backend system. While we have provided an implementation for Firebase (*UserReportingFireStoreUtils*), you can refer to it as a guide for developing your custom backend solution.

2. Update `lib/core/utils/user_report/api/api_manager.dart`:

```dart
var userReportingApiManager = UserReportingCustomBackend();

// var userReportingApiManager = UserReportingFireStoreUtils(); - comment this line

```
