# Ads
## Admob:
By default our apps use Googleâ€™s AdMob service to present ads to users via Native ads, the Ads logic lives in `lib\core\utils\ads\ads_utils.dart`

In order to to serve your own Ads your need to follow these steps:
   + To get started with AdMob, first we must Sign up
   + Add a new app to your newly created AdMob account, so we can obtain our AdMob App ID
## Android Setup
+ Navigate to `android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml`
+ Add the following meta-data tag to your application tag
```mdx
<manifest>
  <application>
    <!-- Sample AdMob App ID: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713 -->
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
      android:value="ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"/>
  </application>
</manifest>
```  
+ Replace the android:value string with your AdMob App ID, You can find your App ID in the AdMob UI
## iOS Setup
+ Navigate to __ios\Runner\Info.plist__
+ Add a __GADApplicationIdentifier__ key with a string value of your AdMob app ID. You can find your App ID in the AdMob UI  
```mdx 
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>Your_Admob_App_ID</string>
```  
+ Add embeded view support
```mdx 
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/>
```
## Dart Setup
Navigate to __lib\services\AdsUtils.dart__
change __AdsUtils.adUnitID__ to your AdMob app ID. You can find your App ID in the AdMob UI
Thatâ€™s it, now you should be able to see Ads that are connected to your AdMob account and start making revenue ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
