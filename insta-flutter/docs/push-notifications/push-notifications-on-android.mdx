# Push Notifications on Android  

Enabling push notifications on Android is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is replace the __Server Key__ of the __notificationManager__ with your own key.   
The steps are detailed [in the previous section](/docs/push-notifications/). 

Make sure you re-build and re-run your app after switching to the correct Server Key.
