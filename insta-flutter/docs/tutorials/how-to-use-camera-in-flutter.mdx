# How to Use the Camera in Flutter

In this article, we’re going to demonstrate how to use the camera on your phone to capture a photo in Flutter and then show it to you on the screen. In the last piece, a significant amount of discussion was devoted to setting up various permissions and conditions.

## Installing the Camera Plugin

The first thing you need to do is install the camera plugin. Through the use of the camera plugin, we will be able to take photographs using the device’s built-in camera. Begin by adding a reliance on the camera in the our flutter project by adding this to your project by heading to `pubspec.yaml` and running <code> flutter pub get </code> :

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera: 0.11.0+2
```

## Starting Code

Take your time to read and understand the following starting code, then copy it into your editor. We will get to know what it does in the coming section.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:camera/camera.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Camera Demo',
      home: HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const HomeScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<HomeScreen> createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}

class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  XFile? image;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
          children: [
            image == null
                ? const Icon(Icons.image)
                : Image.file(File(image!.path)),
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(24.0),
              child: TextButton(
                style: TextButton.styleFrom(
                  backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                ),
                onPressed: () {
                  _showCamera();
                },
                child: const Text(
                  "Take Picture",
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**_showCamera Method**

The `_showCamera` method is in charge of gaining access to the various cameras that are currently accessible, after which it navigates the user to a different view where they may examine the shot. The camera that faces backward will be the first one to be installed.

```dart
void _showCamera() async {
  final cameras = await availableCameras();
  final camera = cameras.first;
  if (!mounted) return;
  final result = await Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => TakePicturePage(camera: camera)));
}
```

## TakePicturePage Setup

There is currently no `TakePicturePage`. The user will be able to take a picture with their camera thanks to `TakePicturePage`. After that, you’ll learn how to show the camera preview to the user and then transmit the recorded picture back to the HomePage so it can be shown on the screen.

**Using the Camera to Take a Picture**

You may snap a picture of yourself by clicking the camera option. The `TakePicturePage` is going to allow them to preview the picture and then capture it with a tap of the button.

The `CameraController` is used to take photos by the `TakePicturePage`. `CameraController` is also used to set up and configure the preview. Here’s how the `TakePicturePage` widget is set up for use:

```dart
class TakePicturePage extends StatefulWidget {
  final CameraDescription camera;
  const TakePicturePage({Key? key, required this.camera}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<TakePicturePage> createState() => _TakePicturePageState();
}

class _TakePicturePageState extends State<TakePicturePage> {
  late CameraController _cameraController;
  late Future _initializeCameraControllerFuture;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _cameraController =
        CameraController(widget.camera, ResolutionPreset.max);
    _initializeCameraControllerFuture = _cameraController.initialize();
  }
}
```

To construct a `TakePicturePage` widget, you must provide a camera as an argument. The `initState` function of the `TakePicturePage` widget is also responsible for initializing the camera controller, making it a stateful widget.

**Camera Preview Implementation**

To make this work, you’ll need to use an Android emulator or an actual Android smartphone. Please be aware that using the iOS simulator to preview or take a photo will not function.

The camera preview implementation is displayed in the following code:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        child: const Icon(Icons.camera),
        onPressed: () => _takePicture(context)),
    body: FutureBuilder(
      future: _initializeCameraControllerFuture,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          return SizedBox(
              width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
              height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
              child: CameraPreview(_cameraController));
        } else {
          return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
        }
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

During the process of evaluating the `_initCameraControllerFuture`, we made use of the `CameraPreview` in order to offer a camera preview. If the `Future` has not yet finished resolving, the `CameraPreview` widget is replaced with a `CircularProgressIndicator()` instead of being shown.


**Fake Room Emulation and Testing**

The Android operating system makes use of a technique known as fake room emulation, which enables users to practice shooting images by means of simulators without first having to install the app on an actual device. Always test the application on a physical device before releasing it to the production environment.

**Taking the Picture**

The very last thing you need to do is snap the image. Our `Stack` now has two children after we added a `FloatingButton` as the second one. The taking of the photograph is going to be controlled by the button. The `_takePicture` function will be executed whenever the button is touched. Here’s how the `_takePicture` method should be implemented:

```dart
void _takePicture(BuildContext context) async {
  try {
    if (!_cameraController.value.isTakingPicture) {
      XFile image = await _cameraController.takePicture();
      if (!mounted) return;
      Navigator.pop(context, image);
    } else {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context)
        ..hideCurrentSnackBar()
        ..showSnackBar(
            const SnackBar(content: Text('Already taking a picture.')));
    }
  } catch (e) {
    debugPrint('$e');
  }
}
```

The first thing that we do is sit back and wait for the `_initializeCameraControllerFuture` to finish resolving. After the future has been determined, we are given the path to the temporary directory where the picture will be stored after it has been saved. In the last step, we instruct the `_cameraController` instance to take a photo by using the `takePicture` method, which then saves the image to a predetermined location. After we have finished taking the image, we will pop the page from the stack, and then we will send back the route by including it as the second parameter in the call to the `Navigator.pop` function. This indicates that the caller may now acquire access to the path and make use of it to show the photograph that was just recently shot.

**Disposing the Camera Controller**

Don’t forget to dispose the `_cameraController` after you are done using it in the dispose function to avoid memory leaks:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _cameraController.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

**Returning to the HomePage Widget**

When we come back to the `HomePage` widget, we get the route from the `Navigator`, and then we set the state in the manner shown below:

```dart
  void _showCamera() async {
    final cameras = await availableCameras();
    final camera = cameras.first;
    if (!mounted) return;
    final result = await Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => TakePicturePage(camera: camera)));
    if (result != null) {
      setState(() {
        image = result as XFile;
      });
    }
  }
```

As a result of the fact that we are altering the value of the `image` variable while the `setState` closure is active, the `build` function will be called, which will ultimately result in the showing of the taken picture. The following is a demonstration of the `build` function’s implementation:

```dart
class _HomeScreenState extends State<HomeScreen> {
  XFile? image;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: SafeArea(
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
          children: [
            image == null
                ? const Icon(Icons.image)
                : Image.file(File(image!.path)),
            Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(24.0),
              child: TextButton(
                style: TextButton.styleFrom(
                  backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                ),
                onPressed: () {
                  _showCamera();
                },
                child: const Text(
                  "Take Picture",
                  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


You should finally be able to do: 
<img
  src={
    require("../../static/img/Screen_recording_20241017_193435.gif")
      .default
  }
  alt="Screenshot of the app"
  style={{ width: "35%", height: "25%", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

## Conclusion

Through reading this article, we have gained the knowledge necessary to get a picture from a physical device and present it on the website. I strongly suggest that you download the code, install the app on a smartphone, and give it a try before making any decisions.
