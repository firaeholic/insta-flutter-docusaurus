# How to Get User Location in Flutter

If you are building a mobile app in Flutter and you are looking to learn how to get the current user location, then this is the tutorial you were looking for. In the current context, there are numerous applications that make use of the device location service to implement various location-based features in the application. In mobile apps such as delivery app, eCommerce app, booking apps, geolocation apps, etc the location service is very essential. So let’s take a look at how to access the location service of a device to get the current location of the user/device.

In this tutorial, we are going to use the geolocator plugin to access the location service of the device and get the current location coordinates of the user. The geolocator library has made the location service access and getting current location coordinates much easier. The idea is to implement a simple UI template to display the current location and a function to fetch the current location using the geolocator library. So, let’s get started!

## Setting up the Flutter Project

First, we need to create a new Flutter project. For that, make sure that the Flutter SDK and other Flutter app development-related requirements are properly installed. If everything is properly set up, then in order to create a project, we can simply run the following command in the desired local directory:

```bash
flutter create flutter_location_example
```

After the project has been set up, we can navigate inside the project directory and execute the following command in the Terminal to run the project in either an available emulator or an actual device:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Scaffolding The App Project

Now, we are going to scaffold the project by removing the default template codes. First, we need to remove the default `MyHomePage` stateful class widget from the `main.dart`. Then, we need to create a new stateful widget class called `CurrentLocation`. This class will hold all the UI template code and the functions to get the current location of the user. The overall code is provided in the code snippet below:

```dart

class CurrentLocation extends StatefulWidget {
  const CurrentLocation({super.key});

  @override
  _CurrentLocationState createState() => _CurrentLocationState();
}

class _CurrentLocationState extends State<CurrentLocation> {
  String? currentLocation;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("Location"),
      ),
      body: SingleChildScrollView(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Container(
                decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.teal[50]),
                padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8),
                child: Column(
                  children: <Widget>[
                    Row(
                      children: <Widget>[
                        const Icon(Icons.location_on),
                        const SizedBox(
                          width: 8,
                        ),
                        Expanded(
                          child: Column(
                            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                            children: <Widget>[
                              const Text('Location'),
                              (currentLocation != null)
                                  ? Text(currentLocation!)
                                  : Container(),
                            ],
                          ),
                        ),
                        const SizedBox(
                          width: 8,
                        ),
                      ],
                    ),
                  ],
                )),
            ElevatedButton(
              style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                backgroundColor: Colors.blue[400],
              ),
              onPressed: () {},
              child: const Text("Get Location"),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

For the template, we have used the Scaffold widget with an App bar and body. The template is simple with the use of a Column widget that houses other widgets. We have kept a Container that will show the location once fetched. Here, we have also used the icon as well. Then, we have ElevatedButton whose onPressed event is empty as of now. Later, we are going to assign a function that grabs the current location value and sets the value to the currentLocation variable. Also, the currentLocation value is used as a conditional rendering to show the location value on the template.

Now, we need to call the class widget in the home option of the MaterialApp widget of MyApp stateless class:

```dart

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const CurrentLocation(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Installing the Geolocator Package

Now, we need to install the package called geolocator that enables us to fetch the location and play around with it. This library provides easy access to platform-specific location services. It offers a cross-platform (iOS, Android) API for generic location (GPS, etc.) functions. Now in order to install this library, we need to add the geolocator to pubspec.yaml file as shown in the code snippet below:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  geolocator: 9.0.1
```

Make sure to upgrade the Flutter/Dart SDK if this plugin does not work.


## Configurations for Android and iOS

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

Now, there are some configurations that need to be done so that our Flutter app can use the plugin properly. First, the geolocator plugin requires the AndroidX version of the Android Support Libraries. Hence, we need to add these support libraries to `gradle.properties` file of `./android` folder as directed below:

```mdx
android.useAndroidX=true 
android.enableJetifier=true
```

Then, we need to make sure that we set the compileSdkVersion in our `./android/app/build.gradle` file to 30:

```dart
android {
  compileSdkVersion 30
  ...
}
```

Now, in order for our Flutter app to access location services from the device, we need to add certain permissions first. For location services to work, we need to add the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` and the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permissions to our `AndroidManifest.xml` file. To add these permissions, go to `./android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add these permissions as a direct child of `<manifest>` tag:

```dart
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

For Android 10, it will be beneficial to add `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission as well. This permission will enable the app to keep receiving updates even when our app is running in the background:

```dart
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

On iOS, you'll need to add the following entry to your Info.plist file (located under `ios/Runner`) in order to access the device's location. Simply open your Info.plist file and add the following (make sure you update the description so it is meaningful in the context of your App):

```dart
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location when open.</string>
```

If you don't need to receive updates when your app is in the background, add a compiler. You can have the flag se by adding the following to the `ios/Podfile` of your application:

```dart

  post_install do |installer| installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target| if
  target.name == "geolocator_apple" target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)',
  'BYPASS_PERMISSION_LOCATION_ALWAYS=1'] end end end end

```

Setting this flag prevents your app from requiring the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` entry in Info.plist, and avoids questions from Apple when submitting your app.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Getting the User Location in Flutter

Now, we are going to implement a function that checks for permissions if the app can use the location service of the device or not and then return the current location of the device or user.

First, we need to initialize a `Position` instance variable that will hold the location position value. Then, we can use the `LocationPermission` instance provided by the geolocator plugin to check the permission. First, we check if the permission to use location is already available for the app using the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>checkPermission()</span> method provided by the geolocator plugin. If not, then, we request to grant permission using the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>requestPermission()</span> method. 

If we manually deny the permission, we assign a "Permission Denied" value to `currentLocation`. Otherwise, we fetch the current position value using the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>getCurrentPosition()</span> method and assign it to the `position` variable. Now, the `position` variable will hold the latitude and longitude value, which we can set to the `currentLocation` variable.

The overall Flutter code for this is provided in the code snippet below:


```dart
  Position? position;

  void _getCurrentLocation() async {
    LocationPermission permission;
    permission = await Geolocator.checkPermission();
    if (permission == LocationPermission.denied) {
      permission = await Geolocator.requestPermission();
      if (permission == LocationPermission.denied) {
        setState(() {
          currentLocation = "Permission Denied";
        });
      } else {
        var position = await Geolocator.getCurrentPosition(
            locationSettings: const LocationSettings(
          accuracy: LocationAccuracy.high,
        ));
        setState(() {
          currentLocation =
              "Latitude: ${position.latitude} , Longitude: ${position.longitude}";
        });
      }
    } else {
      var position = await Geolocator.getCurrentPosition(
          locationSettings: const LocationSettings(
        accuracy: LocationAccuracy.high,
      ));
      setState(() {
        currentLocation =
            "Latitude: ${position.latitude} , Longitude: ${position.longitude}";
      });
    }
  }
```

Lastly, we need to assign this function to the onPressed event of the ElevatedButton widget that we implemented earlier in the template:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    backgroundColor: Colors.blue[400], 
  ),
  onPressed: () async {
      _getCurrentLocation();
  },
  child: const Text("Get Location"),
)
```

Finally, you should get the latlong information of the user and display it as follows

<img
  src={
    require("../../static/img/Screen-Shot-2024-10-18-at-12.06.55-PM.png")
      .default
  }
  alt="Screenshot of the app"
  style={{ width: "45%", height: "35%", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>


As we can notice, once we tap on the “Get location” button, we will be asked if the permission of the device’s location service is to be provided to the app. If allowed, the location position values are displayed on the screen.

## Conclusion
The main objective of this tutorial was to demonstrate how to fetch the current location position of the user or device by using the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}> geolocator </span> package. The availability of this geolocator package made the whole process easier for us. The plugin is capable of much in terms of working with location values and whatnot. We can get the last known location, current location, continuous location updates, check for location permissions, calculate the distance between the locations and bearing. Now, the challenge is to use these features provided by the plugin to create location-centric Flutter applications.
