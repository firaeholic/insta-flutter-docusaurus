# Persistent Storage in Flutter Apps

<Admonition type="info" title="Overview" icon="ðŸ’¡">
In this tutorial, we are going to elaborate on what are the common ways to add support for persistent storage in Flutter apps. More precisely, we are going to create a real app, and showcase in details how to persist data to disk in Flutter apps.
</Admonition>


Most of the mobile applications today store some data that will be used again and again every time the application is launched. On mobile devices, the application can run in the background or exit at any time. While exiting, the app can be in any state. Now, it is necessary for the application code to take care of this without the users having to concern themselves on whether that data of a particular state has been appropriately stored for later access. The management and handling of such a state are known as data persistence which can be done by applying a persistent storage mechanism in the Flutter application. It is necessary to retain the data that was before the application has been shut off.

In this tutorial, we are going to learn about using persistent storage in Flutter apps for data persistence. For that, we are going to make use of the package called [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences). Then, we are going to implement the login state or userâ€™s logged-in session handling as an example use-case to demonstrate the use of persistent storage in Flutter. Along the way, we will also learn the use of different UI widgets as well as configurations to handle the state of different screens. So, letâ€™s get started!

## Setting Up the Project

First, we need to create a new Flutter project. For that, make sure that the Flutter SDK and other flutter app development-related requirements are properly installed. If everything is properly set up, then in order to create a project, we can simply run the following command in the desired local directory:

```bash
flutter create persistent_storage_example
```

## Creating the Login Page

Since we are going to learn about persistent storage for Flutter, what better than to try it on login credentials to handle the user session state in the application. First, we are going to create a Login screen UI. For that, we need to create a file called `Login.dart` in the `./lib` directory of our Flutter project. Then, we can make use of the code from the code snippet below:

```dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Login extends StatefulWidget {
  const Login({super.key});

  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() {
    return LoginState();
  }
}

class LoginState extends State<Login> {
  TextEditingController usernamec = TextEditingController();
  TextEditingController passwordc = TextEditingController();
  final formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("Login"),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          Expanded(
            child: SingleChildScrollView(
              scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
              child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 50.0),
                child: Form(
                  key: formKey,
                  child: Padding(
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
                    child: Column(
                        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                        children: <Widget>[
                          const SizedBox(height: 50),
                          TextFormField(
                            controller: usernamec,
                            decoration: InputDecoration(
                                hintText: 'Username',
                                labelText: 'Username',
                                contentPadding: const EdgeInsets.all(25),
                                border: OutlineInputBorder(
                                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(3.0))),
                            keyboardType: TextInputType.text,
                          ),
                          const SizedBox(height: 15),
                          TextFormField(
                            controller: passwordc,
                            obscureText: true,
                            decoration: InputDecoration(
                                hintText: '*******',
                                labelText: 'Password',
                                contentPadding: const EdgeInsets.all(25),
                                border: OutlineInputBorder(
                                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(3.0))),
                          ),
                          const SizedBox(height: 25),
                          MaterialButton(
                            padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(
                                12.0, 14.0, 12.0, 14.0),
                            color: Colors.black45,
                            shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5.0),
                            ),
                            child: const Text(
                              'Log In',
                              style: TextStyle(
                                  fontSize: 16,
                                  color: Colors.white,
                                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                            ),
                            onPressed: () {},
                          ),
                        ]),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Here, we have placed a basic Scaffold widget with an App bar and body containing a Column widget. The Column widget houses three children widgets. Two for `TextFormField` widgets for username and password and a `MaterialButton` widget for the login button. They are styled using their own available properties. The two `TextFormField` widgets are controlled by their own `TextEditingController`.

## Scaffolding the Home Screen

Now that our login screen UI is ready, we can move on to making some changes to our Home screen UI. The class widget for the Home screen is already available in the `main.dart` file named `MyHomePage`. We need to make a few changes to it to serve our purpose of showing persistent storage in use. The overall changes made to `main.dart` file for the Home page UI is provided in the code snippet below:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key});

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool isLoggedIn = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("Persistant Storage Example"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              (isLoggedIn == true) ? 'You are logged in' : 'You are Logged Out',
              style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: Icon((isLoggedIn == true) ? Icons.logout : Icons.login),
      ),
    );
  }
}


```

Here, we have returned a Scaffold widget with an App bar and body containing the `Text` widget. The Scaffold widget also holds the `floatingActionButton` which will allow us to navigate to the login screen as well as operate as a logout button if a user is logged in. Here, we have also defined a `userLoggedIn` variable with a boolean type which will handle the overall login state of the user. Based on the value of `userLoggedIn` state, we apply conditional rendering to UI as well as functional operations. Now, we need to apply the code to navigate to the Login page in the `onPressed` event of the `FloatingActionButton` widget as shown in the code snippet below:

```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
      Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => const Login(),
        ),
      );
    },
  child: Icon(isLoggedIn ? Icons.logout : Icons.login),
),
```

Hence, we can now see the overall UI of the Home screen as well as the Login screen in the demo below.

<img
  src={
    require("../../static/img/Screen_recording_20241018_141921.gif")
      .default
  }
  alt="Screenshot of the app"
  style={{ width: "35%", height: "25%", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>


## Installing the Package

Now, we are going to install the package called `shared_preferences` that will provide a persistent storage mechanism for Flutter applications. This package provides configurations that wrap platform-specific persistent storage for simple data (`NSUserDefaults` on iOS and macOS, `SharedPreferences` on Android, etc.). Normally, you would have to write native platform integrations for storing data on both iOS and Android. Fortunately, the `shared_preferences` plugin can be used to persist key-value data on disk. To install this package, we need to add the following piece of code to `pubspec.yaml` file as shown in the code snippet below:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences: 2.3.2
```

## Configuring the Login Function

Now, we are going to implement a Login function. In this function, we will make use of the `SharedPreferences` instance. This instance will give us access to different methods such as <span style={{color: 'red'}}>setString</span>, <span style={{color: 'red'}}>setBoolean</span>, <span style={{color: 'red'}}>setInt</span>, etc., which will enable us to store the key-value pair based on the value data type. First, we need to import this package in our `Login.dart` file as shown in the code snippet below:


```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
```

Now, we are going to implement a function called `_performLogin()`. The overall implementation is provided in the code snippet below:

```dart
  _performLogin() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    prefs.setString("username", usernamec.text);
    prefs.setBool("isLoggedIn", true);
    Navigator.push(context,
        MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => const MyHomePage()
        )
    );
  }
```

Here, we have initialized the `SharedPreferences` instance on a variable called `prefs`. Now, using this instance object, we have set two key-value pairs. One to store the username entered in the text field and another to store the user session state called `isLoggedIn` which is of boolean type. Once these two values are stored, we then navigate to the Home page screen.
**_Now, these two values can be accessed from anywhere in the application. Even after the app is closed and launched again, these two values persist until they are explicitly removed._** Now, we need to assign this function to the `onPressed` event of the `MaterialButton` widget representing the Login button as shown in the code snippet below:

```dart
MaterialButton(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(12.0, 14.0, 12.0, 14.0),
  color: Colors.black45,
  shape:  RoundedRectangleBorder(
    borderRadius:  BorderRadius.circular(5.0),
  ),
  onPressed: () {
    _performLogin();
  },
  child: const Text(
    'Log In',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  ),
)
```

## Handle Login State in Home Page using SharedPreferences

Now, we are going to show if the user is logged in or not on the Home page using the same stored key-value pair from the `Login.dart`. The idea is to render out the UI that shows the username of the user as well as a logout button if the user is logged in. Once logged out using the logout button, we show the user has logged out on the screen and show the login button in place of logout. First, we need to import the package in the `main.dart` file as well as shown in the code snippet below:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
```

Now, we need to implement a function that fetches the userâ€™s information and login information that was set during the login operation. The overall implementation is provided in the code snippet below:

```dart
String? username;
SharedPreferences? prefs;

void sharedPreferenceInit () async{
    prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    isLoggedIn = prefs?.getBool("isLoggedIn") ?? false;
    username = prefs?.getString("username");
    setState(() {
    });
}
```

Here, we have created a function called `sharedPreferenceInit` which will initialize the `SharedPreferences` instance for the overall Home page state. Then, we have fetched the `isLoggedIn` value using the `getBool` method assigning the key as the parameter. The returned value is set to `isLoggedIn` variable of the Home page. Then, we have also fetched the username of the user using `getString` method and set it to the `username` variable. In the end, we have called the `setState` function in order to re-render the entire Home page UI once this information is fetched. Since we need this function to run every time the Home Screen is mounted on the app, we need to call this function inside `initState` function as shown in the code snippet below:

```dart
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    sharedPreferenceInit();
  }
```

Note that once we have got a hold of this `isLoggedIn` state, we can use it to handle any user logged-in state operations across the entire application. Now, we can render out the username based on the `isLoggedIn` variable state as shown in the code snippet below:

```dart
body: Center(
    child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[
        Text(
            (isLoggedIn == true)?'You are logged in as: $username': 'You are Logged Out',
            style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
     ],
    ),
    ),
```

## Implementing the Logout Function

Now, we also need a function that will trigger the logout operation. The implementation of the function called `_performLogout` is provided in the code snippet below:

```dart
  _performLogout(){
    prefs?.remove("username");
    prefs?.setBool("isLoggedIn", false);
    sharedPreferenceInit();
    setState(() {
    });
  }
  
```

In this function, we have first removed the key-value pair with key as username using the `remove` method provided by the `SharedPreferences` instance. Then, we have set the `isLoggedIn` key-value to false and call the `sharedPreferenceInit()` function. This will enable us to update the value of the `username` and `isLoggedIn` variables of the Home page state. Now, we need to assign this function to `onPressed` event of the `FloatingActionButton` based on the `isLoggedIn` condition as shown in the code snippet below:

```dart
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    onPressed: (){
      if(isLoggedIn == true){
         _performLogout();
        }else{
          Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) => const Login()
            )
        );
        }
    },
    tooltip: 'Increment',
    child: Icon((isLoggedIn == true)?Icons.logout: Icons.login),
    ),
```

Now based on the `isLoggedIn` state value, either the logout operation is performed or the navigation to the Login screen. The overall result of the use of the persistent storage in the Flutter application to handle the userâ€™s logged-in state is shown in the demo below:


<img
  src={
    require("../../static/img/Screen_recording_20241018_141524.gif")
      .default
  }
  alt="Screenshot of the app"
  style={{ width: "35%", height: "25%", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>


As we can see, once we log in the username of the user is shown on the Home screen, and the button at the bottom corner changes to the logout button. And once logged out is triggered, the user logged out information is shown on the screen, and the button changes to the login button. Similar conditional UI rendering and functional operations can be handled using persistent storage in the Flutter application. The implementation was simple and easy where everything was handled using simple key-value pair storage.

## Conclusion
The main objective of this tutorial was to demonstrate the use of persistent storage in Flutter apps. The article shows its use by taking the user login state handling as an example. The availability of the shared_preferences package made the storing of data to disk easy.

As you can see, our example is a simple store of key-value pairs. But, we can also store objects, arrays, and map type values as well. There are also other packages available for large-scale projects to follow a similar mechanism. You can definitely try them out as well and implement similar functionality. I hope this tutorial was successful in making the concept of persistent storage in the Flutter environment clear and simple.
