# Create a Firebase Account  
First of all, letâ€™s start by creating your own Firebase account. Head over to
[Firebase.com](https://firebase.google.com/) 
 and create an account. Once you have created an account, you get access to your own 
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1). A Firebase account can host multiple Firebase Projects that can host multiple mobile apps.
