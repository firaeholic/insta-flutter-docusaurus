# Enable Firebase Auth
 To enable Firebase Auth, simply go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) ->
 __Authentication__ ->__Sign-in Methods__ and enable the methods that you are going to support in your app. By default, our React Native apps have integration with
  __Email__/__Password__, __Phone__ and __Facebook__.

For Facebook Login, youâ€™ll also need your Facebook App ID. You can add that later when you set up Facebook.
